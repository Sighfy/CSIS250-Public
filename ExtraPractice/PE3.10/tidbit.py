"""
The credit plan at TidBit Computer Store specifies a 10% down payment and an annual interest rate of 12%.
Monthly payments are 5% of the listed purchase price, minus the down payment.

Write a program that takes the purchase price as input. The program should display a table, with appropriate
headers, of a payment schedule for the lifetime of the loan. Each row of the table should contain the following items:

1. The month number (beginning with 1)
2. The current total balance owed
3. The interest owed for that month
4. The amount of principal owed for that month
5. The payment for that month
6. The balance remaining after payment

The amount of interest for a month is equal to balance Ã— rate / 12.

The amount of principal for a month is equal to the monthly payment minus the interest owed.

Example:
Enter the purchase price: 200
