'''
Modify the program from Project 4 to compute the area of a triangle.

Issue the appropriate prompts for the triangle’s base and height, and change the name of the width variable to base.
Use the formula 0.5 × base × height to compute the area.

# Edit the code below (from Project 4)
base = float(input("Enter the base: "))
height = float(input("Enter the height: "))
area = 0.5 * base * height
print("The area is", area, "square units.")
