Package Newtonâ€™s method for approximating square roots (Case Study: Approximating Square Roots)
in a function named newton. This function expects the input number as an argument and returns
the estimate of its square root. The program should also include a main function that allows
the user to compute the square roots of inputs from the user and python's estimate of its
square roots until the enter/return key is pressed.

example:

Enter a positive number or enter/return to quit: 2
The program's estimate is 1.4142135623746899
Python's estimate is 1.4142135623730951
Enter a positive number or enter/return to quit: 4
The program's estimate is 2.0000000929222947
Python's estimate is 2.0
Enter a positive number or enter/return to quit: 9
The program's estimate is 3.000000001396984
Python's estimate is 3.0
Enter a positive number or enter/return to quit
