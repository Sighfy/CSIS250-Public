Elena complains that the recursive newton function in Project 2 includes an
extra argument for the estimate. The functionâ€™s users should not have to
provide this value, which is always the same, when they call this function.
Modify the definition of the function so that it uses a keyword argument
with the appropriate default value, and call the function without a
second argument to demonstrate that it solves this problem.

Example:
Enter a positive number or enter/return to quit: 2

The program's estimate is 1.4142135623746899
Python's estimate is      1.4142135623730951
Enter a positive number or enter/return to quit
