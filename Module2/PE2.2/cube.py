"""
instructions:
You can calculate the surface area of a cube
if you know the length of an edge.
Write a program that takes the length of an
edge (an integer) as input and prints the
cubeâ€™s surface area as output.
An example of the program input and output is shown below:

Enter the cube's edge: 4
The surface area is 96 square units.
"""
# get the variables
cubesEdge = int(input("Enter the cube's edge: "))
cubesSurfaceArea = cubesEdge ** 2 * 6

# print the outcome
print("The surface area is", cubesSurfaceArea, "square units.", end="")
